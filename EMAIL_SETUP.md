```env
EMAIL_USER=your.email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
PORTFOLIO_URL=https://your-portfolio-domain.com
```

### 3. Test the Email Functionality

### 7. Alternative Email Services

If you prefer not to use Gmail, you can modify `lib/email.ts`:

#### For Outlook:

```typescript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: "outlook",
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS,
  },
});
```

#### For Custom SMTP:

```typescript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: "your-smtp-server.com",
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS,
  },
});
```

### 8. Security Notes

ðŸ”’ **Never commit `.env.local`** to version control  
ðŸ”’ **Use app passwords** not your regular Gmail password  
ðŸ”’ **Validate all inputs** both client and server side  
ðŸ”’ **Rate limiting** can be added for production use

### 9. Troubleshooting

**Email not sending?**

- Check your app password is correct
- Ensure 2FA is enabled on Gmail
- Check server logs for error messages
- Verify environment variables are loaded

**Forms not submitting?**

- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API routes are working
- Test with simple data first

**Styling issues in emails?**

- Some email clients strip CSS
- Templates use inline styles for compatibility
- Test with different email providers
